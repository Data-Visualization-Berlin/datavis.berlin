Hey fellow data visualiser,

If you are new in town, welcome to Berlin! To everyone new or already involved in data visualisation, this website aims to guide you through the local scene. Itâ€™s an open list, inspired by the **[Data Visualisation Meetup Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Data-Visualization-Berlin/)** and maintained by [Jonas Parnow](https://jonasparnow.com). You are very welcome to join us for our ~bi-monthly meetup (after Corona). In the meantime, here are some links to help you around. If you have any additional questions, want to participate or [contribute](https://github.com/Data-Visualization-Berlin/Datavis-Berlin-Website) to this website, feel free to contact me through [jonas-at-datavis.berlin](mailto:jonas-at-datavis.berlin) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zeto).
